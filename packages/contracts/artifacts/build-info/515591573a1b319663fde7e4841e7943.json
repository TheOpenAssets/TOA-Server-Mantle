User repays loan + interest (recorded in OAID payment history)\n 5. User withdraws collateral after full repayment\n Liquidation Flows (health factor < 115%):\n \n RWA Token Liquidation (Invoice-backed assets):\n 1. liquidatePosition() - Marks position as liquidated, revokes OAID credit line\n 2. Wait for invoice settlement/maturity\n 3. settleLiquidation() - Burns RWA tokens for USDC yield via YieldVault\n 4. Repay debt, take 10% fee, return excess to user\n \n Private Asset Liquidation:\n 1. liquidatePosition() - Marks liquidated, revokes OAID credit line\n 2.
