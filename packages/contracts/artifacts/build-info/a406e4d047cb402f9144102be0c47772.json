This address can then be used for verification purposes.\n The `ecrecover` EVM precompile allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:\n this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower\n half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.\n IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the\n verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that\n recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {MessageHashUtils-toEthSignedMessageHash} on it."},"id":2343,"implemented":true,"kind":"function","modifiers":[],"name":"recover","nameLocation":"3723:7:7","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":2319,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":2316,"mutability":"mutable","name":"hash","nameLocation":"3739:4:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2343,"src":"3731:12:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":2315,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3731:7:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":2318,"mutability":"mutable","name":"signature","nameLocation":"3758:9:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2343,"src":"3745:22:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"memory","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_memory_ptr","typeString":"bytes"},"typeName":{"id":2317,"name":"bytes","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3745:5:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_storage_ptr","typeString":"bytes"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"3730:38:7"},"returnParameters":{"id":2322,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":2321,"mutability":"mutable","name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2343,"src":"3792:7:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":2320,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3792:7:7","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"3791:9:7"},"scope":2587,"src":"3714:255:7","stateMutability":"pure","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"body":{"id":2392,"nodeType":"Block","src":"4348:342:7","statements":[{"id":2391,"nodeType":"UncheckedBlock","src":"4358:326:7","statements":[{"assignments":[2361],"declarations":[{"constant":false,"id":2361,"mutability":"mutable","name":"s","nameLocation":"4390:1:7","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2391,"src":"4382:9:7","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":2360,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4382:7:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"id":2368,"initialValue":{"commonType":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"id":2367,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"leftExpression":{"id":2362,"name":"vs","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":2350,"src":"4394:2:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"nodeType":"BinaryOperation","operator":"&","rightExpression":{"arguments":[{"hexValue":"307837666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666","id":2365,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"kind":"number","lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"Literal","src":"4407:66:7","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_rational_57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819967_by_1","typeString":"int_const
